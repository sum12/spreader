========

A python based reading tool. To help increase reading speed.

The sole purpose of the dist foler is that anyone who wants to 
tryout the exe, doesnot have to build it. 

TODO:
    find some online builder so that the executables are built
on every upload.

The ui is straight forward. Will post some images for better
understanding of the app. 


##Usage:
The basic functionality is the user copy some text on the clipboard,
and press `New` button on the main screen. And then  press the `Play`
button to start reading the text. (S)he can adjust the speed as required.

The user can also type and paste text directly in *tab 2* and press 
`Play` button to start reading.

Everytime user presses `New` button, new content is loaded from clipboard.

###Spead Control:
For speed control 3 dials have been provided. The 3 dials correspond to
`units`, `tens` and `hundreds` place of the unit `words per minute`.
This I thought was different way to change speed rather than giving a 
slider where acuracy in changing speed is difficult to obtain.
